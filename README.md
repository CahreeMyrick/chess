# C++ Chess Engine (Ichigo)
Ichigo is a C++ chess engine that I built to bridge the intersection between my passion for programming and chess. This project will serve as a tool for exploring various domains of computer science (i.e. OOP, Adverserial Search Algs., Reinforcement learning, Machine Learning, and maybe even systems programming. View this as a space for me to grow and a playground for me to practice with various interesting domians. 

The distribution of Ichigo consists of the following files:
* [README.md][readme-link], the file you are currently reading.
* [include][inlude-link], a subdirectory containing the header files for the source code
* [src][src-link], a subdirectory containing the full source code
